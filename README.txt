How to build application with custom WebKit framework?
    To build applications with this library, copy libs directory to your app root directory and add the build path for RoamTouchWebKit.jar in your eclipse environment. The librtwebcore.so will be automatically bundled in the .apk file when the application is built.
    To use this custom webkit framework, import romtouch.webkit instead of android.webkit in your application.
